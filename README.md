# Micro Compiler
**A very tiny compiler for a just-for-fun language called Micro and it translates it into 3 address code called Tiny.**

_This project could be used as a start point for those who wants to learn more about compilers_

### Tools Used:
[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) is used for generating the code of Scanner and Parser parts of the project, the rest of code is handcrafted by me.
For more help about ANTLR [see their docs](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md)

## About this project
This project was part of compilers course taken in University of Jordan, with Dr. Fahed Jubair (f.jubair@ju.edu.jo).
